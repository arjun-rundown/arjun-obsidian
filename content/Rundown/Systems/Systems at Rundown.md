# Introduction
Hi team this document and the linked documents will guide you through the entire setup process of the knowledge management system that we use at [[Rundown-Agency]]. 

# Our Philosophy
The entire reason for creating a knowledge management system is so that each individual working at [[Rundown-Agency]] is able to store, retrieve and ideate with information that they collect/consume on a daily basis. This aligns perfectly with  ![[Rundown-Agency#Our Values]] 
# Basic Flow and Framework
Our entire system Relies on three components, which include: 
- [[Knowledge Management Framework]] Powered by Obsidian
- [[Individual Task Management]] Powered by Obsidian
- [[Project Management Framework - Teams]] In Sync with Obsidian and Quartz
