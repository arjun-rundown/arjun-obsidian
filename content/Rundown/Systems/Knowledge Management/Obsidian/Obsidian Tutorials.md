 If you don't have a clear understanding of what obsidian still is refer to the doc [[Obsidian]] and come back here. 
 Now let's get started. 

# Properties
Properties in obsidian are the start of every not they hold all the meta data of each notes such as tags, titles, check-boxes and more. Entering properties has a certain syntax please find it below:

# Tags
Tags are one of the core parts of create notes and building connections. You can add a tag to any part of the note by typing pound key (#) and typing the tag next to it. For example, #obsidian. To learn more about tags refer to the following video:

# Links
One of the main things that makes Obsidian work so well is back-links to other notes for references. This helps creating a Wikipedia of all the information that you have collected and helps in understanding relationships between various topics. Refer to the video to understand:

I have covered the core principles of Obsidian in this documentation however there are about a thousand things that have been missed. Therefore, the best way to learn would exactly like I did using YouTube. Find below Links for all the tutorials that you should watch in order to get a complete or at-least 80% of understanding on how to use obsidian. The below list will be updated as I keep learning
